                <p>“Willow” is the first track and the lead single off of Taylor Swift’s second 2020 album ‘evermore.’Taylor Swift revealed “‘willow’ is about intrigue, desire, and the complexity that goes into wanting someone. I think it sounds like casting a spell to make somebody fall in love with you.”</p>

                <h3>Verse 1</h3>
                <span><p>I'm like the water when your ship rolled in that night <br>
                    Rough on the surface, but you cut through like a knife <br>
                    And if it was an open-shut case <br>
                    I never would have known from the look on your face <br>
                    Lost in your current like a priceless wine
                    </p></span>
                    </div>
                <label class="next" for="checkbox-page1"><i class="fas fa-chevron-right"></i></label>
            </div>
            <div class="back-page">
                <div class="content">
                    <p>In the first verse of the song, Taylor Swift narrates the moment where she came across this person, whom now she calls ‘her man.’ Taylor was not open to a relationship at that time, but he just swept her from her feet. Maybe deep down she did want a relationship which is why she says she was only “rough on the surface,” and possibly soft and open on the inside.</p>

                    <h3>Chorus</h3>
                    <span><p>The more that you say, the less I know <br>
                        Wherever you stray, I follow <br>
                        I'm begging for you to take my hand <br>
                        Wreck my plans, that's my man <br></p></span>
                </div>
                
                <label class="prev" for="checkbox-page1"><i class="fas fa-chevron-left"></i></label>

            <div class="front-page">
                <div class="content">
                <p>The chorus of the song elaborates on the process of falling in love. Every word he mutters, Taylor gets drawn in blindly towards him. And she is begging him to marry her; something she had no intentions of doing before she met him. Whatever the lonesome plans she had before are all in wrecks now.</p>
                <h3>Verse 2</h3>
                <span><p>Life was a willow and it bent right to your wind <br>
                    Head on the pillow, I can feel you sneakin' in <br>
                    'Cause if you are a mythical thing <br>
                    Like you were a trophy or a champion ring <br>
                    But there was one prize I'd cheat to win</p></span>

            <div class="back-page">
                <div class="content">
                    <p>Taylor Swift brings back the metaphor of Willow trees to talk about her relationship with him. She swayed by the winds of his presence and the branches bent permanently towards him.

                        Taylor Swift also calls her boyfriend a “trophy or a champion ring.” Both of these items are what you get when you win a contest, and both are somethings you showcase to the world proudly. Taylor is proud to call him her man!</p>
                    <h3>Verse 3</h3>
                    <span><p>Wait for the signal, and I'll meet you after dark <br>
                        Show me the places where the others gave you scars <br>
                        Now this is an open-shut case <br>
                        I guess I should'a known from the look on your face <br>
                        Every bait-and-switch was a work of art 
                        </p></span>

                <p>Taylor Swift talks about the mutual benefits of this relationship. He is a prized trophy for her; understanding, charming, and loving. She promises to heal his scars that previous lovers left on him. We could even say that the ‘open-shut’ nature of the relationship applies to both parties.</p>
