                <p>Taylor Swift's 10-minute All Too Well version is supposedly about her relationship with Jake Gyllenhaal. Here's a deeper dive into the song's lyrics.</p>
                <h3>Verse 1</h3>
                <span><p>I walked through the door with you, the air was cold <br>

                    But something 'bout it felt like home somehow <br>
                    
                    And I left my scarf there at your sister's house <br>
                    
                    And you've still got it in your drawer, even now <br>
                    
                    Oh, your sweet disposition and my wide-eyed gaze <br>
                    
                    We're singing in the car, getting lost upstate <br>
                    
                    Autumn leaves falling down like pieces into place <br>
                    
                    And I can picture it after all these days</p></span>

                    <p>In the first verse, Taylor Swift paints a beautiful picture of how everybody would dream their lives would be with that one special person. This is the start of a relationship-hope is the keyword and everything looks vibrant.

                        Taylor Swift says being with this person made her feel like she was home. She was comfortable and he was warm. It seemed as if all the pieces were falling in perfect fit-like the autumn leaves falling. But little did she know, fall of autumn leaves signify seasonal change where trees hibernate for the winter season. The trees basically die down. Taylor was quite naive and full of love and hope to realize this.</p>
                    <h3>chorus 1</h3>
                    <span><p>And I know it's long gone and <br>
                        That magic's not here no more <br>
                        And I might be okay, but I'm not fine at all <br>
                        
                        'Cause there we are again on that little town street <br>
                        You almost ran the red 'cause you were lookin' over at me <br>
                        Wind in my hair, I was there <br>
                        I remember it all too well</p></span>
                        <p>“All Too Well” is a walk down memory lane-a bitter one at that. She looks back at that time where everything looked colorful. The time has passed long since and she is struggling to unstrap her from the strings.</p>

                <h3>Verse 2</h3>
                <span><p>Photo album on the counter, your cheeks were turning red <br>
                    You used to be a little kid with glasses in a twin-sized bed <br>
                    And your mother's telling stories 'bout you on the tee-ball team <br>
                    You taught me 'bout your past, thinking your future was me</p></span>
                    
                <p> It reminisces about the time Taylor Swift visited Jake Gyllenhaal’s home and met his parents. She remembers checking out the childhood pictures of Jake wearing specs. Jake and his mother chatted up with Taylor Swift telling stories from their childhood thinking she was his future. But autumn leaves were falling.</p>

                <h3>Chorus 2</h3>
                <span><p>And I know it's long gone and <br>
                    There was nothing else I could do <br>
                    And I forget about you long enough <br>
                    To forget why I needed to <br>
                    'Cause there we are again in the middle of the night <br>
                    We're dancing ‘round the kitchen in the refrigerator light <br>
                    Down the stairs, I was there <br>
                    I remember it all too well, yeah</p></span>
                <p>Taylor thinks back to the days and reminds herself that it was a long time ago and it is about time she moved on. But the stronger she tries to forget him, the memories come in flooding as to why she needed him in the first place. It is internal warfare!

                  
                    Taylor Swift is thinking back to the sweet memories they had collected like dancing in the middle of the night in the refrigerator light. She remembers all of these all too well to just wipe it off of memory. Hence, the struggle.</p>

                <p>‘Lost in Translation’ is a movie from 2000 and portrays a short-lived relationship between two strangers. The similarities in the movie and Taylor’s relationship are too similar to just ignore this reference as random.</p>

                        Maybe I asked for too much <br>
                        But maybe this thing was a masterpiece <br>
                        'Til you tore it all up <br>
                        Running scared, I was there <br>
                        I remember it all too well <br>
                        And you call me up again <br>
                        Just to break me like a promise <br>
                        So casually cruel in the name of being honest <br>
                        I'm a crumpled up piece of paper lying here <br>
                        'Cause I remember it all, all, all Too well<br>
